New version checklist
=====================

* readme.txt
	- "Stable tag: x.y.z"
	- check description - still acurate?
	- update Changelog and Upgrade notice
* page-whitelists.php
	- "Version: x.y.z" (in the WP comment block up top)
	- check description - still acurate?
* README.md
	- "Stable version: 3.0.3" (not necessary for the WP version system)
	- copy description and Changelog from readme.txt
* commit new code in svn
	- do `svn up` (to make sure the repo is up-to-date)
	- copy new code to the repo
	- ADD ALL NEW FILES: `svn add --force .`  
	- do `svn stat` (to see that the code has been modified)
	- do `svn diff` (to see the changes)
	- do `svn ci -m "commit message"` (= the commit)
* tag new version in svn
	- do `svn cp trunk tags/x.y.z` (creates the new tag)
	- do `svn ci -m "tagging version x.y.z"` (commits the change)
